# GraalVM Polyglot Application
> Polyglot application using the most popular programming languages: java, python, node and R running with Graal virtual machine

## Prerequisites
#### SDKman
SDKMAN! is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems.
It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates.

[Follow the instructions to install it](https://sdkman.io/install)



## Installation

#### GraalVM
`High-performance polyglot VM`

[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is a standalone Java Development Kit to execute Java or JVM-based languages 
(e.g. Scala, Kotlin), dynamic languages (e.g. JavaScript, R, Ruby, R, Python), LLVM-based languages (e.g. C and C++) in 
one shared runtime, and supports Linux and macOS platforms on x86 64-bit systems. It is available as Community Edition (CE) 
and Enterprise Edition (EE). GraalVM Community Edition is based on the OpenJDK 8. GraalVM Enterprise Edition is developed 
on top of the Java SE 1.8.0_212.

In your terminal run the following commands:
```bash
sdk ls java
sdk i java 19.0.0-grl
sdk u java 19.0.0-grl
gu install native-image
```
gu = Graal Update, the last command is necesary for support native image with graal VM

#### Repository
Download or clone this git repository and navigate into the directory `polyglot-java-js-r`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjeronimomx/polyglot-java-js-r.git
cd polyglot-java-js-r
```

Then install dependencies executing

```bash
~/.sdkman/candidates/java/19.0.0-grl/bin/npm install
```

## Running

You need run the app as a node application, only you need two more arguments:

1. **--jvm** because we are using java code

2. **--polyglot** because we need run an application that is using java, node, python and R languages

```bash
~/.sdkman/candidates/java/19.0.0-grl/bin/node --jvm --polyglot index.js 
```

Then go to your favorite web browser an type: [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)

**ThatÂ´s it** you can see running a simple but an amazing polyglot application
